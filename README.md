# Backtracking
Backtracking Para Resolver Laberinto.
Algoritmo: Backtracking is a problem solving strategy which works with the method "trial and error". A partially detected solution is completed step by step until the final solution is found. As soon as it is clear a partial solution does not lead to the final solution we go back one or several steps and try a new or alternative way.
